# Banking_Data_analysis _South_Africa

In this project I will be conducting an analysis on South African banking data using python. 
The purpose of this project is to gain an indepth understanding of the South African banking sector. This includes understanding of Basel ll and Basel lll. 


# Procedure

I start by writing a script used to merge and transfrom the data from the different files. I then proceed to a simple analysis using data visualizations. 
- To use python to import and transform data.
- To use python as a data analysis tool  
- Data was collected from the South African Reserve bank data. 
- More data that can be used for the same purpose can be found from different reserve banks around the world. 
- It is required to preprocess and merge all files 
- Analyze and comment on data
- Given similar data this analysis can always be repeated for any central bank

NOTE: If you use this notebook locally, remember to set your own paths to files in the notebook
