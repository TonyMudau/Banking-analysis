## Economic Analysis of Capital Adequacy in South African Banks

This Jupyter Notebook file presents an economic analysis of capital adequacy in South African banks using data from the South African Reserve Bank. The analysis focuses on assessing the capital adequacy and liquidity of banks and their importance in the South African banking sector.

### Contents of the Notebook:

1. **Data Preparation:** This section involves importing and preprocessing the data obtained from the South African Reserve Bank. It includes cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and performing necessary transformations for further analysis.

2. **Capital Adequacy Analysis:** Here, various capital adequacy ratios are calculated and analyzed, including Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Adequacy, Tier 1 Capital Adequacy, and Total Capital Adequacy. These ratios measure the banks' ability to absorb losses and maintain a strong capital base, ensuring financial stability.

3. **Liquidity Assessment:** This section focuses on evaluating the liquidity position of South African banks. It involves analyzing liquidity ratios and indicators to assess the banks' ability to meet short-term financial obligations and maintain smooth operations.

4. **Importance of Capital Adequacy and Liquidity:** In this part, a comprehensive explanation is provided on the significance of capital adequacy and liquidity for South African banks. It discusses how these factors contribute to financial stability, protect depositors' funds, and support lending activities to stimulate economic growth.

5. **Conclusion and Recommendations:** The analysis concludes with a summary of findings and recommendations for improving capital adequacy and liquidity in South African banks. It highlights potential areas of concern and suggests measures to strengthen the banking sector's stability.

### Usage Instructions:

To run this notebook, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Python, Jupyter Notebook, and relevant libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. Additionally, download the South African Reserve Bank dataset and place it in the same directory as this notebook. (This has been done already)

Execute each code cell sequentially to perform data preparation, calculate capital adequacy ratios, analyze liquidity measures, and generate visualizations. Feel free to modify the code or add additional analyses as needed.

Please note that this analysis is based on the most recent available data from the South African Reserve Bank up until September 2021.

# Procedure
